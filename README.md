# Fraud_Detection
WHAT:
A project to exemplify my passion and competency for employment.

HOW TO RUN:
Python notebook (.ipynb) can easily run without any steps from the user. I reccomend running on google collabotory from google drive for best convenience. 

DESCRIPTION:
Detected credit card fraud using ML algorithms and created a model to infer hidden strategy of fraudsters
Application to generative adversarial environment in which fraudster attempts to deceive fraud detection AI methods
Demonstrated algorithms such as Boosting, Deep Learning, Decision Trees, GAN, GNN, KNN, Random Forests, SVM

COMPETENCIES:
    ML Algorithms: Compared the performance of several different algorithms, and explained their behavior in our experiment </br>
    Experimental Design Controlled for one variable at a time. Used statistical significane testing. Preformed data analytics.
    Data Preprocessing Cleaned, collected and prepared data for ML models.
    Advanced ML ALgorithms Used generative adverserial model
    Step by Step Explanation I explain my thinking process as thoroughly as possible to prove the breadth and depth of my knowledge
    Data Analytics I demonstrate my ability to go through the entire data data analytics process applied to this dataset
